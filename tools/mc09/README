MC09 is a subset of C compiler. It compiles everything in 1 pass.

Major limitations compared to standard C compilers are:
	1) no float or double
	2) no bit field
	3) limited pre-processor capability (use 'cpp' of UNIX if necessary)
	4) no real long (long is only 2 bytes long)

Non standard features:
	1) #asm and #endasm construction (dangerous, use only after ';' or '}')


Some random notes:

- I saw parsing issues with argument named x
	void moveto(x, y)
	char x;
	char y;
	{...}
- No support for 'unsigned char' (this is unfortunate)
- Issue MSB of v not cleared with:
	unsigned v;
	v = (*VDU);
