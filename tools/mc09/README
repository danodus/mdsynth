MC09 is a subset of C compiler. It compiles everything in 1 pass.

Major limitations compared to standard C compilers are:
	1) no float or double
	2) no bit field
	3) limited pre-processor capability (use 'cpp' of UNIX if necessary)
	4) no real long (long is only 2 bytes long)

Non standard features:
	1) #asm and #endasm construction (dangerous, use only after ';' or '}')
